This repository features projects that utilize the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building APIs and web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
